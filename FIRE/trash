Sooner or later though,
you always have to wake up.
In cryo you don't dream at all.
Doesn't feel like 6 years.
More like after tequila
and ass kicking.
Tommy was the scientist, not me.
He was the one who wanted to get shot light
years out in space to find the answers.
Are we there yet?
Yeah, we're there sunshine.
It's about your brother.
A week before Tommy's
gonna ship out...
A guy with a gun ends his journey.
For the paper in his wallet.
Being in cryo for 5 years,
You will be hungry,
you will be weak.
If you feel noxious...
Tommy was the scientist.
I'm just another dumb grunt going
some place he's gonna regret.
